# Server Side Application Documentation
**Purpose**: To provide a standard place to view the documentation for setting up the server-side application for CEUSS.

## Table Of Contents
*I'm lazy and am not putting this in til later.*

## Command-line Options
The command-line will take in several options. Since the server-side app performs several functions asynchronously,
we need to be able to control certain operations with the command-line. The following is a temporary list of command-line
options:

- `--download` `-d` (args: MM/DD/YYYY)
- `--ingest`, `-i` (args: MM/DD/YYYY)
- `--import`, `-I` (args: filename)
